`prettyping` is a wrapper around the standard `ping` tool with the
objective of making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact,
and easier to read.

`prettyping` runs the standard `ping` in the background and parses its
output, showing the ping responses in a *graphical* way at the terminal
(by using colors and Unicode characters).

`prettyping` is written in `bash` and `awk`, and is reported to work on
many different systems and different versions of `awk`.
